Relaxation Coping Skills:

Simply taking deep, slow breaths can trigger the relaxation response

Yoga, Tai Chi, and exercise can also be relaxing

Progressive Muscle Relaxation

Use guided imagery to imagine yourself in a calming place

Taking time to rest and recharge, a few minutes throughout your day, a few hours
throughout your week.

Taking vacations

Go get a manicure, pedicure, massage, acupuncture, or chiropractic adjustment

Hug someone you love for 10 seconds

Giver yourself a hug or a self-massage

Lay on your floor on your back for five minutes and just breathe, try to make your
stomach go up and down with each breath.

Do an activity that you find immersive and calming- for some people this is sports,
for others is a hobby, one of my relaxing hobbies is metal detecting. When I’m out
metal detecting I don’t worry about things going on at home because my mind is
completely focused on the task at hand, and then when I’m done I go home feeling
more relaxed and energized than before.

Try making yourself some comfort food, like grilled cheese and tomato soup. The
process of cooking and eating a delicious meal can be great for boosting your mood.

Take care of your body in a way that makes you feel good- paint your nails, do your
hair, put on a face mask, etc

Time in nature, soak in some sunlight

Gardening, or another repetitive task that is soothing like knitting.

For many people, physical movement is relaxing when the problem is emotional-so
for those of us who work at desks, relaxation may look like mowing the lawn or
chopping wood, building something with our hands, etc.
